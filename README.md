# Context-Switching Benchmark
Simple program made to emulate a context-switch between a parent and child process, blocking and switching while they share information between two pipes.
The program shows the time elapsed to perform a context switch, in miliseconds, and runs until it is killed.
To use, simply run:
```
make
```
To quit at anytime, kill the program with ^C
